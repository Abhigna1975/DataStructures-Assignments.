Search an Element in a Linked List:
Explain the iterative approach to search for an element in a linked list:

Sure, here's a step-by-step explanation of the iterative approach to search for an element in a linked list:

Start from the Head: Begin at the head node of the linked list. This is where traversal begins.

Initialize Current Node: Set up a pointer to traverse the linked list. This pointer will initially point to the head node.

Iterate through the List: Use a loop to iterate through the linked list. The loop will continue until either the end of the list is reached (current node becomes null) or the desired element is found.

Check Current Node: At each iteration, check if the current node's value matches the element you're searching for.

If Found, Return True: If the current node's value matches the element being searched for, return true. This indicates that the element exists in the linked list.

Move to the Next Node: If the current node's value doesn't match the element being searched for, move the pointer to the next node in the list.

Repeat Steps 4-6: Continue this process until either the element is found or the end of the linked list is reached.

If End of List is Reached: If the loop completes without finding the element (current node becomes null), return false. This indicates that the element does not exist in the linked list.

 Provide a step-by-step explanation.

Certainly! Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to search for an element in a linked list using C++:

Start from the Head Node: Begin at the head node of the linked list. This is the starting point for traversal.

Initialize Current Pointer: Set up a pointer to traverse the linked list. This pointer will initially point to the head node.

Iterate through the List: Use a loop to iterate through the linked list. The loop will continue until either the end of the list is reached (current pointer becomes null) or the desired element is found.

Check Current Node: At each iteration, check if the current node's data matches the element you're searching for.

If Found, Return True: If the current node's data matches the element being searched for, return true. This indicates that the element exists in the linked list.

Move to the Next Node: If the current node's data doesn't match the element being searched for, move the pointer to the next node in the list.

Repeat Steps 4-6: Continue this process until either the element is found or the end of the linked list is reached.

If End of List is Reached: If the loop completes without finding the element (current pointer becomes null), return false. This indicates that the element does not exist in the linked list.
